/**
 The [BugSenseCrashController](BugSenseCrashController) class provides a centralized point of access to BugSense's 
 reporting facilities.
 
 Every application can have exactly one instance of BugSenseCrashController. This instance should be created at the 
 start of the application's lifecycle; typically application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:.
 This instance can only be created using one of the parameter-taking sharedInstanceWith... constructors. Thereafter, you
 can access this instance using the sharedInstance method.
 
 The main role of the controller is to send crash reports to the BugSense service. These are sent either immediately
 after the crash, or on relaunch. Typically, crashes are reported with partially symbolicated stack traces, that contain
 the function/method names and program counter offsets. Fully symbolicated stack traces would included the file and
 line for each call in the stack, but obviously this is impossible to take place on the device. Typically, information
 of this kind is recorded in the dSYM bundle (DWARF) during the archiving process (Xcode).
 
 The controller also provides a facility for informing users of updates for the crashing apps. This can be enabled by
 the developer, through the [BugSense Dashboard](http://bugsense.com/). The controller also provides a facility for
 logging exceptions with tags.
 
 Priority is given to the proper execution/crashing of the app, hence, no guarantee is given that all crashes will be 
 reported accurately and at all times. Experience has shown that, meddling with the crashing process may result to all 
 kinds of errors and data corruption. We avoid this by not meddling too much with the app itself. 
 
 Immediate dispatch for apps that are live on the App Store is discouraged; immediate dispatch is not 100% safe. This is
 because it takes place inside the signal handler and it's not async-safe. Immediate dispatch is recommended for beta
 testing only.
